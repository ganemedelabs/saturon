## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [ganemedelabs@gmail.com](mailto:ganemedelabs@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
